What are at least 2 technical issues you encountered with your project? How did you fix them?

    taking in a input but then making sure it was a integer,
    to debug it i checked that i am taking in a input, then had to see if it was a integer, i thought i was doing it correctly as what i remember you should be doing int(variable), but apparently you have to do variable = int(variable), found this on stackoverflow

    genres_str[i] = (i["name"] + " ")
    TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not dict


b. What are at least 2 known problems (still existing), if any, with your project? (If none, what are two things you would improve about your project if given more time?)
